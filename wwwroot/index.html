    <p1>
        In this class, above learning ASP.NET and C#, I ultimately want to learn how to solve problems on my own and become a quicker learner.
        This is a goal of mine for all four of my core classes, but especially this one because I struggle a bit more with development than the other
        core subjects. I want to learn C# enough to be able to do things on my own. I want to learn how to rely on my own intuition just as much as the videos, so that I can prepare myself better for industry where
        I won't have a TA to turn to.
